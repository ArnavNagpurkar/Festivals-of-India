            India is a land of festivals and culture. In India, more festivals are celebrated as compared to
            the whole world.
        </p>

        <p>Some of these festivals welcome the seasons,
            harvest, rains, and even full moon while the
            others celebrate religious occasions, like the
            birthdays of Gods, or advent of local New
            Years 
        </p>

        <p>Most of the festivals in India are celebrated in
            the whole country but some have different names in the different parts of the country.
